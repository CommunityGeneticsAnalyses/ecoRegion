EcoRegion Analysis
==================

DONE. Along with the vectors, I'd like the time increments changed to 1990,
2040 and 2070.

Also, can we change the colors so that CCV is red, UHP is green and SD
is black? That way there's continuity between the colors here and the
ones used in the map in the supplementary info.

You might consider connecting the points along time for each ecoregion
like we did in the attached paper in Gehring et al. Molecular Ecology
(Fig. 2).  


I was looking at figure B and was wondering if there was a way to
place a map of the US behind the NMDS results? Would that make sense
or do you think it would be too much visually?


I think the three vectors in both panels need explanation
in the fig legend, which seems to be especially important as in panel
(a) they go in different directions, but in panel (b) they all go in
the same direction.
